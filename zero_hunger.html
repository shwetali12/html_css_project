            <p> 43% of Indian children underweight India accounted for almost 43 percent underweight children in the world against 32 percent in Pakistan, 9 percent in South Africa. Nutritional level among the children is the basic element of their overall mental and physical development. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 43 percent of Indian children are underweight. It is very high compared to countries like Pakistan, (32%) China (4%), Brazil (2%) and South Africa (9%). Although malnutrition among the children reduced significantly over time, still the number of malnourished children is very high in the country.

                Under 5 mortality rate and Infant Mortality rate Malnutrition and mortality among children are the two faces of a single coin.
            </p>
            <p> Mortality among infants and under-5 children is also a major concern. In India, the number of under-5 mortality rate and infant mortality rates are 49 and 42, respectively.

            <p>This shows that in spite of the progress made in the health care sector in India,the young population especially in the age group 0-6 years are continuously losing their lives due to inadequate nutrition and proper care. This has resulted in children being stunted, wasted and underweight.
