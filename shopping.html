            <p>The World Bank estimates that India is ranked 2nd in the world of the number of children su­ering from malnutrition, after Bangladesh. The UN estimates that 2.1 million Indian children die before reaching the age of 5 every year – four every minute – mostly from preventable illnesses such as diarrhea, typhoid, malaria, measles and pneumonia. Every day, 1,000 Indian children die because of diarrhea alone. 
                To change these above facts we need enormous support and funds to help and improve the su­ering children.</p>
