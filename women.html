            <h2> WHY WOMEN EMPOWERMENT?</h2>
            <p>Over the past decade, gender equality has been recognized as crucial not only to the health 
                of nations but also to their social and economic development. The promotion of gender equality 
                and women empowerment is a key aspect of UNDP’s Sustainable Development Goals. It involves
                 promoting equal rights, opportunities, and access to resources for women, enabling them to make 
                 independent choices and have control over their lives. Empowered women contribute to economic growth, 
                 social progress, and sustainable development. They play active roles in decision-making processes,
                  education, healthcare, and leadership positions. Women empowerment fosters a more balanced and diverse 
                  society, where women's voices are heard, their talents are recognized, and their potential is fully realized. It is a vital step towards building a more equitable and harmonious world for all.

            <h2>WHAT WE DO?</h2>
            <p>
                Smile Foundation’s women empowerment programme Swabhiman, initiated in 2005, reaches out to 
                marginalized and socially-excluded women with interventions in nutrition, healthcare, and livelihood. 
                The programme capacitates women through innovative community practices, empowering them to seek healthcare and bring
                 sustainable changes in the community, while also supporting them to become aware, skilled, and financially independent.
                  Swabhiman also actively works to create a gender equal society, actively engaging men, and boys to participate in the process of women empowerment.
